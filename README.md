# Writing-Habits

# # What are my writing habits? 
When I write, I typically open up a new document and dive in. I try not to worry to much about the structure of my writing or grammatical errors at first, and I just let the words start flowing. Then, I will read through my rough draft numerous times and try to make corrections as I go. If something doesn't read as easily as I would like, I will reword it until I'm content. I repeat this process until I have a completed piece.

## One Improvement
I think my writing would improve if I took more time to make a rough layout before i started. I think when I take time to jot down the main topic of my paper and the key points i want to touch on that support that topic, my writing becomes more concrete. 

## One Strength
One strength I have in writing is being able to write argumentatively. This is mainly due to a professor I had before College of the Ozarks. We wrote many argumentative papers in her class, and she did a phenomenal job of teaching us how to write in a way that was really effective. She taught us how to create a very clearly defined outline that helped us structure our papers and never stray away from the point we were trying to make.
